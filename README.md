AI-Driven Retail Demand Forecasting Prototype
üéØ Project Overview
This repository hosts an end-to-end prototype for an AI-Driven Demand Forecasting solution. The project‚Äôs primary objective is to optimize inventory management and supply chain operations for a multi-store retailer by providing predictive, actionable sales forecasts.

The solution uses Time Series Machine Learning to predict sales, dramatically reducing the risk of costly stockouts (lost revenue) and excess inventory (waste and holding costs).

üöÄ Business Goal & Problem Statement
Challenge	Impact	AI Solution
Inventory Inefficiency	üìâ Lost sales due to stockouts or inflated costs from overstocking.	Provides a 90% Confidence Interval for future stock planning.
Complex Sales Patterns	Traditional methods (e.g., simple moving averages) fail to account for holidays, leading to forecast errors.	Utilizes the Prophet model to automatically detect and incorporate weekly, yearly, and holiday-specific seasonality.
Data-to-Action Gap	Analytical reports are often too complex for inventory managers to use quickly.	Outputs a single, clear Actionable Inventory Recommendation directly tied to the model‚Äôs prediction.

‚öôÔ∏è Methodology & Model
The prototype leverages a powerful, production-friendly forecasting tool: Prophet (developed by Meta).

Prophet uses a decomposable time series model that explicitly accounts for key components:

y(t)=g(t)+s(t)+h(t)+œµ 
t
‚Äã
 
g(t) (Trend): Models non-linear growth or decline.

s(t) (Seasonality): Models periodic changes (e.g., sales spikes on weekends and in December).

h(t) (Holidays): Models the impact of known, irregular events (e.g., national holidays).

œµ 
t
‚Äã
  (Error): Accounts for random, unexplained variation.

Filtering Strategy
To create a focused prototype, the analysis was restricted to a single, high-volume time series:

Store ID: 1

Product Family: GROCERY I (A high-impact product family where accurate forecasting is critical).

üíæ Data Sources
The project utilizes data from the Kaggle Store Sales - Time Series Forecasting competition.

File Name	Description	Role in Project
train.csv	Historical daily sales for all stores and product families.	Core Training Data (used for the ds and y columns).
holidays_events.csv	Dates and descriptions of public, national, and regional holidays.	External Regressor (Used to model predictable sales spikes/dips around events).
stores.csv / oil.csv	Store metadata and macroeconomic indicators.	Not fully utilized in this prototype but serve as features for future iteration.

üíª How to Run the Prototype
1. Requirements
Clone this repository and create a new Python environment.

Bash

git clone https://github.com/[Your-GitHub-Username]/[Your-Repo-Name].git
cd [Your-Repo-Name]
# Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Data Preparation
Download the train.csv and holidays_events.csv files from the Kaggle competition page.

Place both files directly into the data/ directory.

3. Execution
The entire process is contained within the Jupyter Notebook.

Launch Jupyter Notebook:

Bash

jupyter notebook
Navigate to the notebooks/ folder and open demand_forecasting_prototype.ipynb.

Run all cells sequentially (Cell 1: Data Preparation, Cell 2: Modeling, Cell 3: Visualization & Report).

üìä Key Results and Actionable Insights
The prototype's final output is designed to be instantly usable by a supply chain analyst.

1. Forecast Visualization
The model successfully captures the weekly cyclicality (sales dropping mid-week and rising on weekends) and the overall sales trend.

2. Actionable Report
The prototype converts the raw predicted numbers (yhat) and the confidence interval (yhat_lower) into a specific stocking recommendation, allowing the inventory team to set a safe buffer.

Metric	Value	Business Impact
Total Predicted Sales (60 Days)	[Value: ,.0f] units	Baseline sales expectation for budget and staffing.
90% Confidence Lower Bound	[Value: ,.0f] units	Safety Target: The sales volume the store is 90% sure to exceed.
Final Stock Recommendation	[Value: ,.0f] units	The final number. Stocking this amount (Lower Bound + Safety Buffer) minimizes the risk of running out.
